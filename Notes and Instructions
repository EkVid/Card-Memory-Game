* The python version seems to have problems with trying to read unaccessible files, when running the Project_all.py file,
  pygame and matplotlib seem to not be compatible with each other. Thus, I separated the project into two files, (Project_main_1 and \_2).

* When running the second main file, make sure to empty the terminal first so that pygame will be fully terminated.

* For printing out the table section 'P', maybe not all data is displayed because of the large volume and not enough space in the shell. And the format is a bit odd because of the merging.

- Some countries' data seem to be the same from 1990 - 2019, it's not that the program is not working if you see a straight line in a graph.

- Please go through each section in order, otherwise the program will promopt you back to the main menu except the sections 'P' and 'E'

- The timer is intentionally made a little slower

- When typing United States for plotting, please type "United States" with an asterisk add to it without space. Otherwise it will crash.

The game is designed based on a pygame video tutorial with modifications to fit the purpose of this project

The data for the first plot on the website is gathered from others by playing this game

All information related to memory is collected from this article:

Bipolar Disorder and Anxiety Prevalence Data is downloaded from "Our World in Data - Anxiety Level & Bipolr Disorder"

Note: There isn't any data available for memory loss and anxiety level. The formulas used to predict the likelihood are based on these articles:
